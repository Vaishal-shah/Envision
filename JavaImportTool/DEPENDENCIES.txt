The JavaImportTool application uses parts of the Apache Commons Framework and the Eclipse JDT. To avoid licensing
issues, the dependencies are not included with Envision. They are available for download on-line and you must agree
to their License and Copyright Agreements before using them:
- http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-io/
- http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/
- http://eclipse.org/

Since we use gradle executing gradle build or gradle eclipse will automatically download the required apache libraries.
You can find gradle here:
- http://gradle.org/
However you still need to download and install eclipse manually.
